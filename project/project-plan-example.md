# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Renewable Energy on CO2 Emission Intensity

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What is the relationship between the percentage of renewable energy use and CO2 emission in different countries? Which country should develop more renewable energy sources?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In this project, I aim to explore the correlation between the percentage of renewable energy use and CO2 emissions across different countries. I plan to use descriptive statistics and data visualization to analyze the data. The findings from this project could provide valuable insights into how the use of renewable energy affects CO2 emissions, which could be instrumental in developing strategies to reduce CO2 emissions while promoting renewable energy use.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: CO2 Emission by countries Year wise (1750-2022)
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moazzimalibhatti/co2-emission-by-countries-year-wise-17502022
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides data on the CO2 emission, population, and area of different entities (countries).

### Datasource1: Renewable Energy Share
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhoseinmousavian/renewable-energy-share?select=share-electricity-renewables.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides the percentage of renewable energy (equivalent primary energy) used in a given year for each entity (country).
